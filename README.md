<h1 align="center">Karen Virtual Assistent</h1>
Karen was created in 2017 in pascal and over time it was translated into Python around 2018 and 2019. It had several versions before being posted here, but I didn't know the platform.

Its main focus is to meet people's urgent needs, such as: mathematical calculations, internet searches, checking the time or date, among others...
